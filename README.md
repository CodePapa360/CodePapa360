<hr />

Self-taught Front-End Web Developer 🚀 with an insatiable curiosity for crafting digital experiences. 🎨 My journey began with the trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've been on an exciting adventure ever since.

Passionately weaving code and creativity together, I specialize in creating pixel-perfect designs that not only catch the eye but also provide seamless user experiences.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. In my spare time, I enjoy designing websites, coding, and playing video games. I'm also interested in problem solving and learning new things.

I've completed over 40 design challenges on Frontend Mentor, and you can check out my work there to see my skills in action. All of my challenge solutions are available as repositories in my GitHub profile, so you can see my code and how I approached each challenge.

I'm excited to be a part of the open source community and to contribute to the development of great web applications. I believe that everyone should have access to the power of the web, and I'm committed to making that happen.

### 🤝Let's connect:

I'm always excited to collaborate and learn from fellow developers, designers, and dreamers.
